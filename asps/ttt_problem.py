# State and Action Representations:
#
# - A (game) state is a TTTState that contains game board and the index of the
#   player to move
#
# - An action is a pair that represents the location at which a player
#   would like to draw an X or an O: (<index of row>, <index of column>),
#   where the indices start at 0.
#
# - See the main function at the bottom of this file for an example.
